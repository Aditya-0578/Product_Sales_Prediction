## Overview

This project aims to build predictive models for estimating product sales based on historical data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dataset

- Describe your dataset here (e.g., source, size, features).
- Example: The dataset includes features such as product category, price, store location, date, and historical sales.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aditya-0578/Product_Sales_Prediction.git
cd Product_Sales_Prediction

Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or, if using Jupyter Notebooks, install common packages:

bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
**##Usage**
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook
Run the notebooks step by step to explore the data and train the models.
